# Building Blockchain Projects
This is the code repository for [Building Blockchain Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/building-blockchain-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787122147), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will teach you what Blockchain is, how it maintains data integrity, and how to create real-world Blockchain projects using Ethereum. With interesting real-world projects, you will know learn how to write smart contracts which run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party interference, and build end-to-end applications for Blockchain. You will learn concepts such as cryptography in cryptocurrencies, ether security, mining, smart contracts, and solidity.
##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

chapters 1, 2, 3 do not have any code files.
chapter 1 is introduction, chapter 2 is setup and chapter 3 have minimal one class codes.

The code will look like the following:
```
var solc = require("solc"); 
var input = "contract x { function g() {} }"; 
var output = solc.compile(input, 1); // 1 activates the optimizer  
for (var contractName in output.contracts) { 
    // logging code and ABI  
    console.log(contractName + ": " + output.contracts[contractName].bytecode); 
    console.log(contractName + "; " + JSON.parse(output.contracts[contractName].interface)); 
}
```

You require Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10 or Mac OS X 10.8+.
